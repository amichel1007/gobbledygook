# Introduction to Quantitative & Computational Legal Reasoning  (LAW:8645)

Spring 2019; Monday + Tuesday 12:40-2:10; Classroom 125.

Professor: Paul Gowder (Office: 408. Email: paul-gowder@uiowa.edu. Phone: 319-384-3202.).

Assistant: Diana DeWalle (Office: 469. Email: diana-dewalle@uiowa.edu. Phone: 319-335-9036.).

## Course Summary

This course will review basic principles of probability, statistics, and computational reasoning (including elementary programming) for law students. Throughout, the emphasis will be on mathematically modest intuition, practical skills, and legal applications. No mathematical background beyond high school algebra will be assumed.

This course is not advised for students with substantial statistical or computational backgrounds---it is designed as a beginner course. Nor will it prepare students to be competent empirical researchers or computer programmers---the goal is to give students the capacity to critically evaluate and understand statistical reasoning, and to use computational methods to do so (as well as in their legal practices more generally). Focus will be on breadth rather than depth, as well as legal applications.

Introduction to Quantitative and Computational Legal Reasoning is experimental. This syllabus is not a contract; I reserve the right to make radical changes in how the course operates throughout the semester, depending on how student learning progresses.

## Course Materials

- Course website: [https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/](https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/) 

- [Course Github repository](https://github.com/paultopia/quantitative-methods-for-lawyers) (I will explain how to use this in the beginning of the semester.)


## Readings 

#### Texts

The main readings for this course will be drawn from [Charles Severance, Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/book), which is available for free online, and [Michael Finkelstein & Bruce Levin, Statistics for Lawyers](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-5985-0) which should be free to download as PDF through our library's subscription. (You may have to be on the campus network to download it; you might also have to search for it through the library's directory.) We will also (probably) be using some excerpts from the [Federal Judicial Center's Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence](https://www.fjc.gov/content/reference-manual-scientific-evidence-third-edition-1) 

In addition, we'll make use of some videos and exercises from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), which has free accounts available for educational purposes; I will explain how to get access on the first day.  

We will also use some free instructional materials from the nonprofit organizations [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and (maybe) [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/). 

There will also be copious readings written by me available online on the public-facing website, and some copyrighted stuff that I can't distribute publicly on ICON.

I am committed to only assigning resources which are free to students. However, the nature of this material is that sometimes one explanation will just "click" where another might not.  So in addition to the assigned readings, I offer you this list of additional, non-free, readings which you might consult for a different perspective on the material---or for deeper engagement and exploration.  

### Bonus Reading Suggestions: Statistics

I really like the Aspen textbook by Lawless, Robbennolt and Ulen, [Empirical Methods in Law](http://www.aspenlawschool.com/books/empirical_methods/). It has very good clear explanations of a number of research methods topics, and is not overly math-y. If you want to dig deeper into stats and empirical research in law, I highly recommend it.  I also recommend Lee Epstein & Andrew Martin, [An Introduction to Empirical Legal Research](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/an-introduction-to-empirical-legal-research-9780199669066?cc=us&lang=en&). 

If you want to do serious research on your own, you will need to move to more advanced texts, but the direction you go will depend on the particular kind of research you want to conduct. For expermental research, especially experimental research out in the world (like the kinds of things done by discrimination testers, about which we will talk), a classic text is Gerber & Green [Field Experiments: Design, Analysis and Interpretation](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/an-introduction-to-empirical-legal-research-9780199669066?cc=us&lang=en&); if you are more interested in observational research, I really like Angrist & Pischke, [Mastering Metrics](http://masteringmetrics.com/). Both of those books are rather-more math-y than the others (or our class).

Charles Wheelan, *Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data*, is a well-liked book on the other end of the spectrum---it focuses on intuitive and non-math-y explanations of statistics topics. It's quite good in that respect, but I'm not fully comfortable recommending it for other reasons. The author thinks he's funnier than he actually is, and the book features a number of fairly tasteless, and in some cases offensive, jokes. If you can put up with that, however, the book is good at explaining stats in a clear way.

Some other books that might be of interest to you, though I haven't reviewed them as closely and hence can't clearly endorse, include:

- Peter Bruce & Andrew Bruce, Practical Statistics for Data Scientists

- Michael A. Bailey, Real Stats: Using Econometrics for Political Science and Public Policy

- Uri Bram, Thinking Statistically


### Bonus Reading Suggestions: Python Programming

My favorite introductory Python book (not free) is John Guttag, [Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-revised-and-expanded-edition).  This book is also the basis for a wonderful electronic [course by almost the same name from MIT on EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python) --- and you can go through the course for free, and without buying the book.  I really do think that course (and the second course in the same series) is an amazing way to learn Python, and programming in general.

Blessedly, there are a lot of good introductory Python programming books out there which are also available online for free. One of my favorites is Al Sweigart, [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com). For more advanced (and non-free) learning, I really love Luciano Ramalho's [Fluent Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do), although by the time you need that you should be looking at building fairly substantial programs. 

It is better to use a Python book that is based on Python 3, not Python 2. 


### Bonus Reading Suggestions: General Learning

I highly recommend Barbara Oakley's book [A Mind for Numbers](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/a-mind-for-numbers/), which is basically a self-help book on the psychology of learning difficult things---which can help you not just in math-y classes but in law school and other classes in general. There's an online course based on her book on Coursera, called [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn); I've never looked at that course but everyone who has done so has raved about it. 

## How Class Will Go

This course is structured as a "flipped class": there won't be many (or possibly any) lectures (or Socratic interrogation). Rather, you will consume the talking kind of instruction outside of the classroom, primarily through readings and through some third-party videos. Classroom time will mostly be a lab format: I will demonstrate the practical usage of the things you've learned about outside of class, and (more commonly) assign exercises for you to carry out, with the opportunity to work together to figure them out and with me looming over your shoulder to help. 

Please bring a computer to every class. Mac, Linux, or Windows computers will work best. Chromebooks and tablets will work less well, though we can get them to work if need be. 

The coverage, pace, and workload in this class will be a continuing work in progress. Because this class isn't taught a lot in law schools, there is not much collective wisdom on how to do it successfully, and I expect to have to adapt the assignments and the pace to accommodate how readily the class takes to the material. So don't expect the assignments at the bottom of this document to be stable. They will change. Possibly lots. I haven't even written the assignments beyond a few weeks out, because I expect that they'd need to be radically changed. In other words, **this course is experimental**---I'll do my best to make it worth your while, but I disclaim all warranties about how well it will work this first time around. 

### Class Platforms

The nature of this class is such that we will not be able to limit ourselves just to resources provided by the University of Iowa. We will avail ourselves of a variety of other platforms through the semester, including: 

- [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com)

- [Github](https://github.com)

- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)

I'll walk you through getting access to these resources on the first day of class.

In addition, every session will be recorded on Panopto and available on ICON; we'll also use ICON to administer some quizzes (probably), turn in assignments, and distribute materials which (for copyright reasons, etc.) we're not allowed to distribute outside of the class. Also, you will use the discussion feature of ICON to share information and ask questions out of class.

This class is intended in part to produce resources which will be available to the legal profession at large in order to help your fellow lawyers understand code and stats as well; accordingly, many of the reading assignments will be to lessons posted on this website at sociologicalgobbledygook.com. Those assignments will also be available on the course GitHub repository; you will find it useful to get the assignments there in order to execute and mess around with the code yourself. 


## Evaluation

Evaluation will be primarily based on four problem sets. The first two will be computer programming-based, and will be worth 17.5% of the grade each. The third will be probability and statistics based and will be worth 25% of the grade.  The fourth will be comprehensive, with emphasis on the statistics side, and will be worth 30% of the grade.

The weird fractions are to accommodate 10% of the grade which will be based on classroom participation and preparation, and which is meant to enforce the flipped classroom format. Students who get full credit for that 10% will complete the simple out-of-class tasks which I will periodically assign, pass the easy in-class pop-quizzes which I will periodically announce, and participate in good faith in collective problem-solving in the classroom. (This is an effort-based 10%, not a performance-based 10%.) 

Under the policy described in Student Handbook section B.3 ("The curve is not applicable in upper-level seminars and other upper- level classes in which a student's grade is based primarily on the student’s performance on graded skills-oriented tasks (including writing) other than a final exam."), this course will not be curved.

In order to ensure that students in this course aren’t disadvantaged by unfamiliarity with the format or a collection of too-hard problem sets on which everyone struggles, there will be a floor for the distribution of grades for this course: at the lowest, the median grade for this course will be the official law school median of 3.3. In other words, you can’t do worse than the standard curve would otherwise dictate. But you can do better. 

### Collaboration

Problem sets should be your own work. You are allowed to discuss the general approach to problem sets with one another, but you are not allowed to show one another your math or code. 

For example: "I solved that problem by writing a loop over the list of cases" is acceptable. "Look at this code I wrote" is not. 

Students will be asked to agree to an honor code.

Collaboration on in-class tasks and on homework assignments that are not one of the official problem sets is highly encouraged and probably necessary. 

## Technology, Bugs, and Accommodations

This course will be technologically driven, obviously. Please let me know ASAP if there are any glitches of any kind.

Also, please contact me or the dean of students as soon as humanly possible if you need accommodations, so that these accommodations can be built into the tech. All course materials will be provided in formats that I believe are accessible (e.g., to screen readers), however, if I'm mistaken about their accessibility, please let me know and the problem will promptly be fixed.

## Office Hours, Contacts, etc.

I will maintain office hours Mon., Tue. 10-30am to noon, and 2:30-3:30pm. I'm also happy to make appointments at other times, and you're always free to drop by when my door is open. I'm very good at replying to e-mail and very bad at checking telephone messages.

That being said, I **very strongly encourage you to ask substantive questions in a way that will be accessible to your fellow students**.  This means using the copious time that will be made available in class time for that purpose, as well as making use of the discussion forum on ICON (in which I will very actively participate).  If you have a question, it's almost certainly the case that several other people do too.

## Some schedule notes

Monday, Jan 21 is Martin Luther King Day.  No classes then, obviously. Spring Break is March 16-24.


### Learning outcomes

By the end of the course, you should be able to:

- Write simple Python scripts to automate common tasks and explore data

- Visualize data, and understand basic data visualizations 

- Understand common errors made in empirical research and quantitative claims, and identify those errors in published and expert reports.

- Conduct basic statistical analyses.

- Reason about probability and statistics at a sufficient level to be an informed consumer of quantitative claims.

## Coverage by Week

The first few weeks will be spent on computation; subsequent weeks will be spent on data analysis and statistics. As we get further into the future, the below becomes more subject to change, obviously. (From week 3 onward, reading is still being added.)

I fully expect that we won't get to the material in the last few weeks, unless we somehow move at rocket speed. They're more aspirational topics. Everything past week 3 will probably be shuffled around several times as I see how fast the class progresses.

### Week 1 

Coverage: Basic ideas of programming, units of computation, functions and loops. Computational logic and legal logic, law as computation. We will front-load the quantity of reading a little heavily to get us started quickly, but it'll ease off as we move on to more conceptually difficult material. (Also, I know the reading seems like a lot, but it goes faster than cases in 1L year!)  In particular, don't feel obliged to fully absorb everything from Python for Everybody on the first reading. Just read it quickly so you get a feel for the terrain, and then more carefully read the stuff posted on this site, then dig back into Python for Everybody to fill out the details.

For **Monday**, read the [Introduction to Python on this site]({filename}../Lessons/python_intro.md) and the [first Python lesson]({filename}../Lessons/basic_intro.ipynb). Read pages 1-55 of Python for Everybody. Also read the [Software Carpentry lesson on loops](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/02-loop/index.html).

In the first day of class, we will get everyone set up with the different services and installation options for the software we need in the course, and, if there's time, demonstrate some basic programming ideas and work through some exercises.

On Monday evening, read clone the course Github and complete the exercise at the end of the first Python lesson notebook (factorial); you don't need to turn it in, but let me know if you can't complete it; we'll look at people's solutions on Tuesday and use this as our test to make sure everyone is set up and functional.

For **Tuesday**, read the [functions and scope]({filename}../Lessons/functions.ipynb), [more loops and control flow]({filename}../Lessons/control_flow.ipynb), [simple data types]({filename}../Lessons/simple_data_types.ipynb), and [complex data types]({filename}../Lessons/complex_data_types.ipynb)  lessons on this site. Also read the Software Carpentry lessons on [functions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/06-func/index.html) and [making choices](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/05-cond/index.html).


### Week 2

Coverage: using Python to get access to other people's code, libraries. Accessing the filesystem and the internet from Python. Error handling. Strings.

Between week 1 and week 2, go through chapters 1-3 of DataCamp's [Introduction to Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) course. You don't need to do chapter 4 (about the Numpy library) right now, though you can if you want to. Also read pg. 56-126 of Python for Everybody.  

Monday is a holiday (MLK day).  For **Tuesday**, read [Libraries]({filename}../Lessons/libraries.md), [Errors]({filename}../Lessons/errors.ipynb), [Files and Strings]({filename}../Lessons/files-and-strings.ipynb) and [Network Requests]({filename}../Lessons/network_requests.md) on this site. 


### Week 3

Watch: Peter Donnelly's TED talk [How Statistics Fools Juries](https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_donnelly_shows_how_stats_fool_juries)

### Week 5

Initial explorations into data with data visualization in Python. Basic properties of data, measures of central tendency, exploratory data analysis.

Read: [Introduction to stats]({filename}../Lessons/intro-stats.md), [Exploring data]({filename}../Lessons/exploratory_intro.ipynb)

### Week 6

Probability distributions, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing. 

Read: [Distributions]({filename}../Lessons/distributions.ipynb), [The Normal Distribtion]({filename}../Lessons/normal_clt.ipynb), and [Hypothesis Testing]({filename}../Lessons/hypothesis-testing-intro.md).

Also read these two excellent blog posts by a Google data scientist: [Statistics for People in a Hurry](https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-for-people-in-a-hurry-a9613c0ed0b) and [Never Start With a Hypothesis](https://towardsdatascience.com/hypothesis-testing-decoded-for-movers-and-shakers-bfc2bc34da41).

Problem set 2 due.


### Week 7

Experiments, random assignment.  Causation and correlation.

Focused legal application: audit tests in discrimination cases.

### Week 8

P-values, p-hacking, publication bias, the replication crisis in psychology, power and underpoweredness, multiple comparisons, and other terrible pitfalls of scientific research.  

Read: [P-Values and Bayes Rule]({filename}../Lessons/pvals2.md), Peter Norvig's blog post [Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation](http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html). 

Discussion: what are the legal implications of scientific failures?

### Week 14

Algorithmic accountability. Discrimination by computer, and legal implications of statistical discrimination (intentional racial profiling and unintentional racial profiling).  Natural language processing, if time permits. 

### Final exam period

Problem set 4 due (no standard final exam).
