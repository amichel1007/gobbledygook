Title: Welcome!

Welcome to Introduction to Quantitative and Computational Legal Reasoning, informally named "Sociological Gobbledygook" in honor of [Chief Justice Roberts's slightly math-phobic remark at oral argument in Gill v. Whitford](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-is-allergic-to-math/).  This course will be offered at the University of Iowa College of Law in Spring 2019, by [Paul Gowder](https://gowder.io).

Currently, the course is a work in progress. By the beginning of Spring semester, hopefully all lessons will be up (although, realistically, the best I can probably hope for is the first third or so---the syllabus will be complete though!). Until that point, anything up here is subject to change.

Also, this is a totally open-source course. There is a [Github repository](https://github.com/paultopia/quantitative-methods-for-lawyers) with developing materials and discussions. Please feel free to make a suggestion or start a conversation in the issues, or even make a pull request.

To see the materials that are released thus far (in draft form), use the links at the top of this page.
