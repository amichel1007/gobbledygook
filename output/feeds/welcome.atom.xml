&lt;p&gt;Currently, the course is a work in progress. By the beginning of Spring semester, hopefully all lessons will be up (although, realistically, the best I can probably hope for is the first third or so---the syllabus will be complete though!). Until that point, anything up here is subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this is a totally open-source course. There is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/paultopia/quantitative-methods-for-lawyers"&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt; with developing materials and discussions. Please feel free to make a suggestion or start a conversation in the issues, or even make a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the materials that are released thus far (in draft form), use the links at the top of this page. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
