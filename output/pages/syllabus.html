    <h1>Introduction to Quantitative &amp; Computational Legal Reasoning  (LAW:8645)</h1>
<p>Spring 2019; Monday + Tuesday 12:40-2:10; Classroom TBD.</p>
<p>Professor: Paul Gowder (Office: 408. Email: paul-gowder@uiowa.edu. Phone: 319-384-3202.).</p>
<p>Assistant: Diana DeWalle (Office: 469. Email: diana-dewalle@uiowa.edu. Phone: 319-335-9036.).</p>
<h2>Course Summary</h2>
<p>This course will review basic principles of probability, statistics, and computational reasoning (including elementary programming) for law students. Throughout, the emphasis will be on mathematically modest intuition, practical skills, and legal applications. No mathematical background beyond high school algebra will be assumed.</p>
<p>This course is not advised for students with substantial statistical or computational backgrounds---it is designed as a beginner course. Nor will it prepare students to be competent empirical researchers or computer programmers---the goal is to give students the capacity to critically evaluate and understand statistical reasoning, and to use computational methods to do so (as well as in their legal practices more generally). Focus will be on breadth rather than depth</p>
<h2>Course Materials</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Course website: <a href="https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/">https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/</a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/paultopia/quantitative-methods-for-lawyers">Course Github repository</a> (I will explain how to use this in the beginning of the semester.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use several freely available books, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Charles Severance, <a href="https://www.py4e.com/book">Python For Everybody</a> --- available for free online, or for print purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional TBD</strong></p>
<h3>Recommended additional reading</h3>
<p>If you would like more written material to support your learning in this course, I recommend the following books: </p>
<h4>Basic</h4>
<p>John Guttag, Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python</p>
<h4>Advanced</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lee Epstein &amp; Andrew Martin, An Introduction to Empirical Legal Research</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Evaluation will be based on four problem sets. The first two will be computer programming-based, and will be worth 20% of the grade each; the last two will be probability and statistics based and will be worth 30% of the grade each.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Student Handbook section B.3 ("The curve is not applicable in upper-level seminars and other upper- level classes in which a student's grade is based primarily on the student’s performance on graded skills-oriented tasks (including writing) other than a final exam."), this course will not be curved.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that students in this course aren’t disadvantaged by unfamiliarity with the format or a collection of too-hard problem sets on which everyone struggles, there will be a floor curve for this course: at the lowest, the median grade for this course will be the official law school median of 3.3. In other words, you can’t do worse than the standard curve would otherwise dictate.</p>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>Problem sets should be your own work. You are allowed to discuss the general approach to problem sets with one another, but you are not allowed to show one another your math or code. </p>
<p>For example: "I solved that problem by writing a loop over the list of cases" is acceptable. "Look at this code I wrote" is not. </p>
<p>Students will be asked to agree to an honor code on the first day of class.</p>
<h2>Technology, Bugs, and Accommodations</h2>
<p>This course will be technologically driven, obviously. Please let me know ASAP if there are any glitches of any kind.</p>
<p>Also, please contact me or the dean of students as soon as humanly possible if you need accommodations, so that these accommodations can be built into the tech. All course materials will be provided in formats that I believe are accessible (e.g., to screen readers), however, if I'm mistaken about their accessibility, please let me know and the problem will promptly be fixed.</p>
<h2>Office Hours, Contacts, etc.</h2>
<p>I will maintain office hours (<strong>TBD: Add this.</strong>). I'm also happy to make appointments at other times, and you're always free to drop by when my door is open. I'm very good at replying to e-mail and very bad at checking telephone messages.</p>
<h2>Some schedule notes</h2>
<p>Monday, Jan 21 is Martin Luther King Day.  No classes then, obviously. Spring Break is March 16-24.</p>
<h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
<p>By the end of the course, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write simple Python scripts to automate common tasks and explore data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visualize data, and understand basic data visualizations </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand common errors made in empirical research and quantitative claims, and identify those errors in published and expert reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct basic statistical analyses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reason about probability and statistics at a sufficient level to be an informed consumer of quantitative claims.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Coverage by Week</h2>
<p>The first few weeks will be spent on computation; subsequent weeks will be spent on data analysis and statistics.</p>
<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p>Basic ideas of programming, units of computation, functions and loops. Computational logic and legal logic, law as computation.</p>
<p>For <strong>Monday</strong>, read the <a href="/introduction-to-python.html">Introduction to Python on this site</a>. Watch the video <strong>link tbd</strong> on getting started with Azure Notebooks and Github, and follow those instructions, run Lesson 0 notebook <strong>link tbd</strong> to make sure everything is working, and read pages 1-55 of Python for Everybody.</p>
